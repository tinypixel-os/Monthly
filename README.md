Started learning how to build iOS widgets with [Sean Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jucm6e9M6LA) for a side project idea.

In this project we created a minimalistic widget to see the day and date of the month.

Although this was a basic widgets, I had a ton to learn with this
- how to add a "Widget extension" to the existing iOS app.
- learn the terminilogies for a widget - provider, timeline, snapshot, preview size, etc.
- [design great widgets - WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10103/)
- [human interface guidelines for widgets](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/widgets)

The best part was being able to see the widget in the widget gallery 😍

Moving on to work on my side project now. 🛠️👨🏻‍💻
